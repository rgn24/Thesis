\begin{itemize}
    \item complex geometry
    \item temperature dependent capillary rise?
    \item surfactants and capillary rise?
    \item more fluids with other viscosisties
    \begin{itemize}
        \item as delanoy discussed the viscosity plays a major role in the capillary rise
    \end{itemize}
    \item in depth reseach of gamma value and possible dependence of mesh resolution
\end{itemize}
