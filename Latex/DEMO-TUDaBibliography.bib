  abstract = {Wetting is fundamental to many technological applications that involve the motion of the fluid-fluid interface on a solid. While static wetting is well understood in the context of thermodynamic equilibrium, dynamic wetting is more complicated in that liquid interactions with a solid phase, possibly on molecular scales, can strongly influence the macroscopic scale dynamics. The problem with continuum models of wetting phenomena is then that they ought to be augmented with microscopic models to describe the molecular neighborhood of the moving contact line. In this review, widely used models for the computation of wetting flows are summarized first, followed by an overview of direct numerical simulations based on the Volume-of-Fluid approach. Recent developments in the Volume-of-Fluid simulations of the wetting are then reviewed, with a particular attention paid on combining macro-scale simulations with the hydrodynamic theory near the moving contact line, as well as including a microscopic description by coupling with the van der Waals interface model. Finally, the extension to modeling the contact line motion on non-flat surfaces is surveyed, followed by hot topics in nucleate boiling.},

The concept of contact line mobility or friction is discussed, and an angle-dependent model is formulated. The results of numerical simulations based on this model are compared to the detailed experimental results of Xia and Steen with good general agreement. The total energy input in terms of work done by the oscillating support, and the dissipation at the contact line, are calculated from the simulated results. It is found that the contact line dissipation is almost entirely responsible for the dissipation that sets the amplitude of the response. It is argued that angle-dependent line friction may be a fruitful interpretation of the relations between contact line speed and dynamic contact angle that are often used in practical computational fluid dynamics.},

  abstract = {Wettability is an important parameter that significantly determines hydrology in porous media, and it especially controls the flow of water across the rhizosphere—the soil-plant interface. However, the influence of spatially heterogeneous distributions on the soil particles surfaces is scarcely known. Therefore, this study investigates the influence of spatially heterogeneous wettability distributions on infiltration into porous media. For this purpose, we utilize a two-phase flow model based on Lattice-Boltzmann to numerically simulate the infiltration in porous media with a simplified geometry and for various selected heterogeneous wettability coatings. Additionally, we simulated the rewetting of the dry rhizosphere of a sandy soil where dry hydrophobic mucilage depositions on the particle surface are represented via a locally increased contact angle. In particular, we can show that hydraulic dynamics and water repellency are determined by the specific location of wettability patterns within the pore space. When present at certain locations, tiny hydrophobic depositions can cause water repellency in an otherwise well-wettable soil. In this case, averaged, effective contact angle parameterizations such as the Cassie equation are unsuitable. At critical conditions, when the rhizosphere limits root water uptake, consideration of the specific microscale locations of exudate depositions may improve models of root water uptake.},

It is not accidental that the earliest descriptions of the moving wetting line and its associated dynamic contact angle were in terms of displaced equilibria (chemists), friction (physicists) and viscous bending of the liquid–vapour interface (engineers and mathematicians). Each of these approaches has progressed since its inception, but, while each reflects a different facet of the underlying physical mechanism, and each offers at least a semi-empirical route to its description, none is complete. There is, as yet, no fully agreed treatment that is consistent with all three viewpoints and provides an effective basis for prediction—though at least one new hydrodynamic approach has emerged that goes some way in this direction. This paper seeks to offer a status report: to briefly review each of the current approaches, to illustrate their successes and limitations as revealed by experiment and simulation, and to suggest ways in which the different aspects of wetting dynamics might be investigated in the future.},

However, little is known on the local stresses the fiber substrates experiences and, in turn, the local forces acting on those droplets while moving on vertical fiber strands. This work is concerned with disclosing the influence of droplet volume, viscosity, and chemical substrate heterogeneity on droplet motion. For this purpose, we pursue a computational simulation campaign by means of direct numerical simulations resolving all relevant spatial and temporal scales. On the basis of local simulation data, we evaluate and analyze effective viscous dissipation rates as well as viscous and capillary forces. We also assess the validity of an assumption, which is frequently used in correlations for droplets moving on single-fiber strands—neglecting the capillary force. Our computational analysis allows to falsify/verify this assumption for different scenarios and reveals that such correlations have to be applied with care, particularly when it comes to chemical heterogeneity of the fiber substrates.},

  abstract = {Fluid flow in porous systems driven by capillary pressure is one of the most ubiquitous phenomena in nature and industry, including petroleum and hydraulic engineering as well as material and life sciences. The classical Lucas−Washburn (LW) equation and its modified forms were developed and have been applied extensively to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying the basic statics and dynamics of the capillary-driven flow in porous systems. The LW equation assumes that fluids are incompressible Newton ones and that capillary channels all have the same radii. This kind of hypothesis is not true for many natural situations, however, where porous systems comprise complicated pore and capillary channel structures at microscales. The LW equation therefore often leads to inaccurate capillary imbibition predictions in such situations. Numerous studies have been conducted in recent years to develop and assess the modifications and extensions of the LW equation in various porous systems. Significant progresses in computational techniques have also been attained to further improve our understanding of imbibition dynamics. A state-of-the-art review is therefore needed to summarize the recent significant models and numerical simulation techniques as well as to discuss key ongoing research topics arising from various new engineering practices. The theoretical basis of the LW equation is first introduced in this review and recent progress in mathematical models is then summarized to demonstrate the modifications and extensions of this equation to various microchannels and porous media. These include capillary tubes with nonuniform and noncircular cross sections, discrete fractures, and capillary tubes that are not straight as well as heterogeneous porous media. Numerical studies on the LW equation are also reviewed, and comments on future works and research directions for LW-based capillary-driven flows in porous systems are listed.},

  journaltitle = {Advances in Colloid and Interface Science},
  abstract = {Capillary imbibition, such as plant roots taking up water, reservoir rocks absorbing brine and a tissue paper wiping stains, is pervasive occurred in nature, engineering and industrial fields, as well as in our daily life. This phenomenon is earliest modeled through the process that wetting liquid is spontaneously propelled by capillary pressure into regular geometry models. Recent studies have attracted more attention on capillary-driven flow models within more complex geometries of the channel, since a detailed understanding of capillary imbibition dynamics within irregular geometry models necessitates the fundamentals to fluid transport mechanisms in porous media with complex pore topologies. Herein, the fundamentals and concepts of different capillary imbibition models in terms of geometries over the past 100 years are reviewed critically, such as circular and non-circular capillaries, open and closed capillaries with triangular/rectangular cross-sections, and heteroge­ neous geometries with axial variations. The applications of these models with appropriate conditions are dis­ cussed in depth accordingly, with a particular emphasize on the capillary flow pattern as a consequence of capillary geometry. In addition, a universal model is proposed based on the dynamic wetting condition and equivalent cylindrical geometry to describe the capillary imbibition process in terms of various solid topologies. Finally, future research is suggested to focus on analyzing the dynamics during corner flow, the snap-off of wetting fluid, the capillary rise of non-Newtonian fluids and applying accurate physical simulation methods on capillary-driven flow processes. Generally, this review provides a comprehensive understanding of the capillarydriven flow models inside various capillary geometries and affords an overview of potential advanced de­ velopments to enhance the current understanding of fluid transport mechanisms in porous media.},

  abstract = {In this article, we present a modelling approach for rapid dynamic wetting based on the phase field theory. We show that in order to model this accurately, it is important to allow for a non-equilibrium wetting boundary condition. Using a condition of this type, we obtain a direct match with experimental results reported in the literature for rapid spreading of liquid droplets on dry surfaces. By extracting the dissipation of energy and the rate of change of kinetic energy in the flow simulation, we identify a new wetting regime during the rapid phase of spreading. This is characterized by the main dissipation to be due to a re-organization of molecules at the contact line, in a diffusive or active process. This regime serves as an addition to the other wetting regimes that have previously been reported in the literature.},

Here, we calculate the shape of the interface near a slip surface for arbitrary angles, and for two phases of arbitrary viscosities, thereby removing a key restriction in being able to apply small capillary number theory. Comparing with full numerical simulations of the viscous flow equation, we show that the resulting theory provides an accurate description up to                                                                      \$Ca \textbackslash approx 0.1\$                                               in the dip coating geometry, and a major improvement over theories proposed previously.},

  abstract = {The self-diffusion of fluids in nanotubes generally consists of both molecule–molecule and molecule–wall interactions, which can be quantitatively described by the Knudsen mechanism and the molecular mechanism, respectively. Combining these two effects, the Bosanquet equation is generally used to predict the self-diffusivities of molecules in one-dimensional nanopores. In this work, equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations were employed to investigate the validity of the equation in predicting the self-diffusivities of fluids inside carbon, boron nitride, and silicon carbide nanotubes with diameters from ∼1.0 to 4.3 nm. Our results indicate that although the Bosanquet equation can predict the self-diffusivities of H2, Ar, CH4, CO2, C2H6, and C3H8 in carbon nanotubes in the same order of magnitude, the accuracy of these predictions is generally rather poor. At high and moderate loadings, the large deviation mainly results from the limited accuracy of the simplistic free path model, which tends to neglect the intermolecular forces of fluid molecules. However, at low loadings, the failure of the Bosanquet equation can be traced to the failure of the Knudsen model, which largely underestimates the diffusivity in nanotubes due to the smoothness of the tube wall. Furthermore, the Bosanquet equation fails to predict the self-diffusivities of H2O in confinement since the presence of hydrogen bonding violates the mean free path theory. It is suggested that further modification of this extrapolation should take into account the intermolecular forces of fluid molecules as well as the smoothness of the tube wall.},

The first part of the review begins with a description of the LBM and the original pseudopotential model. The distinct features and the limitations of the original model are described in detail. Then various enhancements necessary to improve the pseudopotential model in terms of decreasing the spurious currents, obtaining high density/viscosity ratio, reducing thermodynamic inconsistency, unraveling the coupling between surface tension and equations of state (EOS), and unraveling the coupling between viscosity and surface tension, are reviewed. Then the fluid–solid interactions are presented and schemes to obtain different contact angles are discussed. The final section of this part focuses on the multi-component multiphase pseudopotential model. The second part of this review describes fruitful applications of this model to various multiphase flows. Coupling of this model with other models for more complicated multiple physicochemical processes are also introduced in this part. Ó 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Liquid infiltration is one of the commonly adapted flow mechanisms in microscale/nanoscale heat-transfer applications. The theoretical modeling of dynamic infiltration profile in the microscale/nanoscale requires a deep study, because the acting forces are entirely different from those of a large-scale system. Herein, a model equation is developed from the fundamental force balance at the microscale/nanoscale level, to capture the dynamic infiltration flow profile. Molecular kinetic theory (MKT) is used to predict the dynamic contact angle. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to study the capillary infiltration in two different geometries. The infiltration length is computed from the simulation results. The model is also evaluated over surfaces having different surface wettability. The generated model provides a better estimation of the infiltration length, compared to the well-established models. The developed model is expected to aid in the designing of microscale/nanoscale devices where liquid infiltration plays a key role.},

We focus here on the early dynamics of the rise of viscous liquids, and report an initial regime of constant velocity contrasting with Washburn's prediction. This is explained by considering the contact line friction at the liquid front, and confirmed by the influence of prewetting films on the tube walls, whose presence is found to speed up the rise and more generally to provide an ideal framework for quantifying the friction at contact lines.},

Diffuse-interface models have been used previously primarily for densitymatched fluids, and it remains unclear to what extent such models can be used for fluids of different density, thereby potentially limiting the application of these models. In this paper, the convective Cahn–Hilliard equation and the condition that the velocity field is divergence-free are derived from the conservation law of mass of binary mixtures in a straightforward way, for fluids with large density and viscosity ratios. Differences in the equations of motion with a previously derived quasi-incompressible model are shown to result from the respective assumptions made regarding the relationship between the diffuse fluxes of two species. The convergence properties of the model are investigated for cases with large density ratio. Quantitative comparisons are made with results from previous studies to validate the model and its numerical implementation. Tests show that the variation in volume during the computation is of the order of machine accuracy, which is consistent with our use of a conservative discretization scheme (finite volume methods) for the Cahn–Hilliard equation. Results of the method are compared with previous work for the change in topology of rising bubbles and Rayleigh–Taylor instability. Additional results are presented for head-on droplet collision and the onset of droplet entrainment in stratified flows.},

  abstract = {We present an efficient scheme within the phase field framework for imposing dynamic contact angle boundary conditions for wall-bounded flows of two immiscible incompressible fluids with large density ratios. First, we develop an algorithm for imposing the dynamic contact angle boundary conditions to the Cahn–Hilliard equation. Our algorithm consists of two components: (i) we ignore the boundary conditions and transform the Cahn–Hilliard equation into two nominally de-coupled Helmholtz type equations; (ii) we treat the dynamic contact angle boundary conditions in such a manner that the two Helmholtztype equations are truly de-coupled. Then, we combine this algorithm, together with a scheme for variable-density Navier–Stokes equations we developed recently, to form an efficient method for the coupled system of Navier–Stokes and Cahn–Hilliard equations for contact line problems involving large density ratios. The overall method can deal with moving contact lines under dynamic and also static contact angle boundary conditions. It is endowed with several attractive features that make the method very efficient. In particular, computations for all flow variables are completely decoupled. The resultant linear algebraic systems after discretization for all flow variables involve only constant and time-independent coefficient matrices, which can be pre-computed during pre-processing, even though the coupled Navier–Stokes/Cahn–Hilliard system involves variable density and variable viscosity. Ample numerical simulations of wall-bounded air/water two-phase flows have been presented to demonstrate the capability of the method for dealing with contact line problems under dynamic and static contact-angle conditions involving large density ratios.},

  abstract = {The rise of a liquid column inside a thin capillary against the action of gravity is a prototypical example of a dynamic wetting process and plays an important role for applications but also for fundamental research in the area of multiphase fluid dynamics. Since the pioneering work by Lucas and Washburn, many research articles have been published which aim at a simplified description of the capillary rise dynamics using complexity-reduced models formulated as ordinary differential equations. Despite the fact that these models are based on profound simplifications, they may still be able to describe the essential physical mechanisms and their interplay. In this study, we focus on the phenomenon of oscillations of the liquid column. The latter has been observed experimentally for liquids with sufficiently small viscosity leading to comparably small viscous dissipation. Back in 1999, Qu´er´e et al. formulated a condition for the appearance of rise height oscillations for an ODE model introduced by Bosanquet in 1923. This model has later been extended to include further dissipative mechanisms. In this work, we extend the mathematical analysis to a larger class of models including additional channels of dissipation. We show that Qu´er´e’s critical condition is generalized to Ω + β {$<$} 2, where Ω was introduced earlier and β is an additional non-dimensional parameter describing, e.g., contact line friction. A quantitative prediction of the oscillation dynamics is achieved from a linearization of the governing equations. We apply the theory to experimental data by Qu´er´e et al. and, in particular, reveal the oscillatory behavior of dynamics for the nearly critically damped case of ethanol.},

The implicit t (h) solution by Washburn is the basis for these calculations and the Lambert W function is used for its mathematical rearrangement. The original equation is derived out of the 1D momentum conservation equation and features viscous and gravity terms. Thus our h(t) solution, as it includes the gravity term (hydrostatic pressure), enables the calculation of the liquid rise behavior for longer times than the classical Lucas–Washburn equation. Based on the new equation several parameters like the steady state time and the validity of the Lucas–Washburn equation are examined. The results are also discussed in dimensionless form.},

In this period both inertia and viscous flow losses balance the pressure generated by the meniscus curvature (capillary pressure). It is known that the very first stage is purely dominated by inertial forces, where subsequently the influence of viscosity increases (visco-inertial flow). Finally the effect of inertia vanishes and the flow becomes purely viscous. In this study we derive the times and meniscus heights at which the transition between the time periods occur. This is done in an attempt to provide a method to determine a priori which terms of the momentum balance are relevant for a given problem. Analytic solutions known from previous literature are discussed and the time intervals of their validity compared. The predicted transition times and the calculated heights show good agreement with experimental results from literature.

Das Benetzungsverhalten führt zu einem Kapillareffekt, der das Wasser in den Spalt treibt. Für die Darstellung dieses Kapillareffektes spielt die Bewegung der Dreiphasenkontaktlinie eine entscheidende Rolle und ist wegen der Haftbedingung an Wänden nicht trivial lösbar. Aus diesem Grund wird die Phasenfeld-Methode angewendet, die eine Bewegung der Dreiphasenkontaklinie durch Diffusion ermöglicht. Dabei wird der Löser "PhaseFieldFoam“ verwendet, der in einer Kooperation zwischen dem Karlsruher Institut für Technologie und der Technischen Universität Darmstadt als Erweiterung zu OpenFOAM entwickelt wird. Zunächst wird das Eindringverhalten von Wasser in eine Kapillare und einen Spalt zwischen zwei parallelen Platten anhand analytischer Vergleichslösungen validiert. Hierzu wird eine Parameterstudie mit Kontaktwinkel von 15°, 45° und 85° und Kapillardurchmesser/Plattenabstände von 1 mm 0,1 mm und 0,01 mm durchgeführt. Es ergeben sich gute Übereinstimmungen mit der analytischen Lösung, die allerdings stark von der richtigen Wahl des Mobilitätsparameters abhängen. Anschließend werden drei verschiedene komplexe Dichtspaltgeometrien simuliert und miteinander verglichen. Es kann festgestellt werden, dass das Verhalten in komplexen Dichtspaltgeometrien und der so genannte pinning-Effekt phänomenologisch korrekt abgebildet werden. Zuletzt wird ein Dichtspalt simuliert, bei dem der Kontaktwinkel linear entlang der Wand variiert. Es zeigt sich, dass der variable Kontaktwinkel von der Simulation korrekt wiedergegeben wird.},

  abstract = {An extensive experimental study of the kinetics of capillary rise in borosilicate glass tubes of different sizes and cross-sectional shapes using various fluid systems and tube tilt angles is presented. The investigation is focused on the direct measurement of dynamic contact angle and its variation with the velocity of the moving meniscus (or capillary number) in capillary rise experiments. We investigated this relationship for different invading fluid densities, viscosities, and surface tensions. For circular tubes, the measured dynamic contact angles were used to obtain rise-versus-time values that agree more closely with their experimental counterparts (also reported in this study) than those predicted by Washburn equation using a fixed value of contact angle. We study the predictive capabilities of four empirical correlations available in the literature for velocity-dependence of dynamic contact angle by comparing their predicted trends against our measured values. We also present measurements of rise in noncircular capillary tubes where rapid advancement of arc menisci in the corners ahead of main terminal meniscus impacts the dynamics of rise. Using the extensive set of experimental data generated in this study, a new general empirical trend is presented for variation of normalized rise with dynamic contact angle that can be used in, for instance, dynamic pore-scale models of flow in porous media to predict multiphase flow behavior.},

  abstract = {We studied several wetting boundary conditions (WBCs) in the numerical simulation of binary fluids by using phase-field method. Five WBCs, three using the linear, cubic, and sine form surface energy (LinSE, CubSE, and SinSE), the other two using the geometric formulation (Geom) and the characteristic interpolation (CI), were compared through the study of several problems: (1) the static contact angle (CA) of a drop; (2) a Poiseuille flow-driven liquid column; (3) a wettability gradient (WG)-driven liquid column; and (4) drop dewetting. It was found that while all WBCs can predict the static CA fairly accurately, they may affect the simulation outcomes of dynamic problems differently, depending on the CA. For the flow-driven problem with a CA near 90ı, using different WBCs had almost no effect on the flow characteristics over a large scale. For the WG-driven problem, to use different WBCs may lead to different steady drop velocities, and all WBCs except LinSE can give reasonably consistent prediction between the drop velocity and dynamic CAs. For drop dewetting, Geom led to the most violent drop motion, whereas CubSE caused the weakest motion. For several problems, CubSE and SinSE gave almost the same results, and those by Geom and CI were also close, possibly due to similar consideration in their design. Besides, a new implementation that may be used for all WBCs was proposed to mimic the wall energy relaxation and control the degree of slip. This new procedure made it possible to allow the simulations to match experimental measurements well. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

General theorems and formulations are developed to obtain a physical momentum equation that is compatible with the mass transport, kinetic energy conservation, and Galilean invariance, regardless of the form of the Phase-Field equation, by applying the consistency of mass conservation and the consistency of mass and momentum transport. Then, the multiphase flow model is completed by combining the momentum equation with a reduction consistent Phase-Field equation. After developing a mass conservative and reduction consistent scheme for the Phase-Field equation and a momentum conservative scheme for the momentum equation, they are physically connected following the proposed general theorems to honor the consistency conditions on the discrete level. The surface force is discretized by either the conservative method, which is shown to be momentum-conservative, or the balanced-force method, which achieves a better mechanical equilibrium. The final scheme is 2nd-order accurate, decoupled, consistent, and (essentially) conservative depending on which method for the surface force is implemented. The properties of the scheme are all numerically validated. Numerical applications show that the proposed model and scheme are robust and effective to study complicated multiphase dynamics, especially for those including large-density ratios.},

  abstract = {An investigation is made into the moving contact line dynamics of  a Cahn–Hilliard–van der Waals (CHW) diffuse mean-field interface.  The interface separates two incompressible viscous fluids and can evolve  either through convection or through  diffusion driven by chemical potential gradients. The purpose of this paper is to show  how the CHW moving contact line compares to the classical sharp interface contact  line. It therefore discusses the asymptotics of the CHW contact line velocity and  chemical potential fields as the interface thickness ε and the mobility κ both go to  zero. The CHW and classical velocity fields have the same outer behaviour but can  have very different inner behaviours and physics. In the CHW model, wall–liquid  bonds are broken by chemical potential gradients instead of by shear and change of  material at the wall is accomplished by diffusion rather than convection. The result  is, mathematically at least, that the CHW moving contact line can exist even with  no-slip conditions for the velocity. The relevance and realism or lack thereof of this  is considered through the course of the paper.                            The two contacting fluids are assumed to be Newtonian and, to a first approximation,  to obey the no-slip condition. The analysis is linear. For simplicity most of  the analysis and results are for a 90° contact angle and for the fluids having equal  dynamic viscosity μ and mobility κ. There are two regions of flow. To leading order  the outer-region velocity field is the same as for sharp interfaces (flow field  independent of               r               ) while the chemical potential behaves like               r               −ξ               , ξ = π/2/max\{θ               eq               ,  π − θ               eq               \}, θ               eq               being the equilibrium contact  angle. An exception to this occurs for θ               eq               = 90°,  when the chemical potential behaves like ln               r               /               r               . The diffusive and viscous contact line  singularities implied by these outer solutions are resolved in the inner region through  chemical diffusion. The length scale of the inner region is about 10√μκ – typically  about 0.5–5 nm. Diffusive fluxes in this region are               O               (1). These counterbalance the  effects of the velocity, which, because of the assumed no-slip boundary condition,  fluxes material through the interface in a narrow boundary layer next to the wall.                          The asymptotic analysis is supplemented by both linearized and nonlinear finite  difference calculations. These are made at two scales, experimental and nanoscale.  The first set is done to show CHW interface behaviour and to test the qualitative  applicability of the CHW model and its asymptotic theory to practical computations  of experimental scale, nonlinear, low capillary number flows. The nanoscale calculations  are carried out with realistic interface thicknesses and diffusivities and with  various assumed levels of shear-induced slip. These are discussed in an attempt to  evaluate the physical relevance of the CHW diffusive model. The various asymptotic  and numerical results together indicate a potential usefullness for the CHW model  for calculating and modelling wetting and dewetting flows.},

  abstract = {The major problem regarding numerical simulation of multiphase flows in microfluidic systems are discrepancies in the results with the ones obtained by the same numerical approaches in larger scales. Several potential causes such as the effect of confining boundaries, large curvature of interfaces or small sizes of dispersed phases are reported elsewhere. To determine the effect of these properties on numerical results, a sensitivity analysis on the most important parameters affecting the fluid dynamics of a microfluidic multiphase system is required. The aim of this thesis is to compare the Volume of Fluid (VOF) and Phase Field methods implemented in OpenFOAM package, in solvers interFoam and phaseFieldFoam, respectively, in terms of their basic suitability to simulate multiphase flows. For this purpose, interFoam in foam-extend-3.1 and phaseFieldFoam in OpenFOAM-1.6-ext are used. By doing so, problematic parameters of microfluidic multiphase simulations can be identified. The case study of interest is a two dimensional motionless air bubble in stagnant water. This configuration is frequently discussed in literature as a validation case. The simplicity of this case makes it suitable as a fast benchmark to achieve the target of this study. The starting point of the research is therefore the comparison between the numerical results obtained for this configuration with the ones reported in literature. For this benchmark problem, mismatch between discretised surface tension force and pressure gradient and/or inaccurate computation of interface curvature can lead to numerical errors, which manifest as parasitic currents. These currents strengthen when there exist discontinuities in field variables (e.g., density and pressure) at the interface between the air bubble and water. Thus, in the second step, this error and its consequences such as motion of bubble and distortion of its interface are characterised. To do so, several parameters such as spatial and temporal resolutions of the numerical solvers, initial estimation for bubble interface thickness and bubble diameter have been changed. The accuracy of the solvers is determined based on their ability to predict the pressure difference between the gas inside the bubble and the surrounding liquid and minimising the induced parasitic current and bubble motion, while maintaining an appropriate bubble interface thickness. The results show that the phaseFieldFoam is more accurate in predicting most of the characteristic properties of the considered multiphase system, compared to interFoam. Under mesh refinement, the former code converges with equal densities and viscosities but not for air-water system where the magnitude of spurious currents is independent from grid size. Furthermore, it is revealed that phaseFieldFoam requires at least six computational cells across the thickness of bubble interface to provide accurate results. It is also shown that to achieve convergence, satisfying common criteria on the group of involved non-dimensional numbers (here, Courant and Cahn numbers) is not sufficient. A further restriction originates from the computational time step. By refining the time step, the diffusion number, which is shown to influence the solution significantly, can be controlled and as a result, convergence of the results can be obtained. Moreover, the main drawback of phaseFieldFoam is illustrated to be in conserving the mass of the gas phase inside the bubble as the solver tends to shrink the bubble size. This problem, however, could be overcome by a higher mesh resolution. On the other hand, although interFoam does not suffer from problems in mass conservation, it is out of step in prediction of the characteristic parameters as well as in eliminating the parasitic current and unfavourable bubble motion. The adopted approach for tackling this problem is beneficial for numerical simulation of three-dimensional microfluidic systems with complex flow geometries, both for design and optimisation purposes.},

Direct observation of wetting-controlled imbibition in mesopores is anticipated to deliver important insights into the interplay between nanoconfined liquid movement and nanoscale wettability. We present a systematic study of water imbibition into mesoporous silica thin films with wetting properties precisely adjusted through chemical functionalization. We observe the liquid infiltration, resulting in an imbibition ring around the water droplet, by top-view imaging using a camera with collimated coaxial illumination. With decreasing hydrophilicity, the maximum imbibition area around the droplet decreases, accompanied by a simultaneous change in the imbibition kinetics and imbibition mechanism. Initially, the imbibition kinetics follow a modified Lucas–Washburn law that considers a strong influence of evaporation. However, with increasing imbibition time after reaching constant imbibition ring dimensions, the imbibition area starts to increase again, causing a deviation from the applied model. This observation is ascribed to water-mediated surface activation at the imbibition front, leading to a slightly increased wettability, which is also confirmed by water adsorption measurements. Furthermore, recently described spontaneous condensation-evaporation imbalances that cause oscillations of the imbibition front could be verified and were studied with regard to changing wetting properties. By increasing the contact angle of the material and therefore the partial pressure needed for capillary condensation, the amplitude of the imbibition front oscillations decreases. These results provide insights into the wettability-defined complex movement of water in mesoporous structures, which has practical implications,               e.g.               , for nano/microfluidic devices and water purification or harvesting.},

  abstract = {The motion of the three-phase contact line between two immiscible fluids and a solid surface arises in a variety of wetting phenomena and technological applications. One challenge in continuum theory is the effective representation of molecular motion close to the contact line. Here, we characterize the molecular processes of the moving contact line to assess the accuracy of two different continuum two-phase models. Specifically, molecular dynamics simulations of a two-dimensional droplet between two moving plates are used to create reference data for different capillary numbers and contact angles. We use a simple-point-charge/extended water model. This model provides a very small slip and a more realistic representation of the molecular physics than Lennard-Jones models. The Cahn–Hilliard phase-field model and the volume-of-fluid model are calibrated against the drop displacement from molecular dynamics reference data. It is shown that the calibrated continuum models can accurately capture droplet displacement and droplet break-up for different capillary numbers and contact angles. However, we also observe differences between continuum and atomistic simulations in describing the transient and unsteady droplet behaviour, in particular, close to dynamical wetting transitions. The molecular dynamics of the sheared droplet provide insight into the line friction experienced by the advancing and receding contact lines. The presented results will serve as a stepping stone towards developing accurate continuum models for nanoscale hydrodynamics.},

It has, however, been shown to be insufficient at very short times due partly to the lack of inertial terms. Bosanquet (1) applied an inertial term via momentum, Szekely et al. (2), examined single capillaries based on a revised boundary-condition model, and Sorbie et al. (3) reviewed and applied Szekely’s work to examine the effects of comparative imbibition into a parallel pore-doublet. The study here extends the work of Sorbie et al. by applying the equation of Bosanquet to a three-dimensional network model, Pore-Cor. All authors agree that, with the inclusion of inertial terms at short times, smaller radius capillaries will initially fill faster than larger radius capillaries which disagrees with the Washburn equation. It is shown that the aspect ratio of a capillary, defined as its length divided by its radius, plays an important role, in combination with the capillary radii themselves, in determining the filling rate of individual elements. The distribution of this ratio associated with the capillary throat elements within a network structure is investigated. The result is that a preferred pathway of permeation is observed under supersource imbibition conditions in the case where a broad size distribution of capillary elements occurs within a network structure.},

We show that local-resistance sources, such as the inertial resistance and the friction caused by the advancing meniscus, always limit the motion of an imbibing front. Both effects give rise to a cross-over of the growth exponent between the linear and the diffusive-like regimes. We show how this cross-over is much longer than previously thought – even longer than the time it takes the liquid to fill the porous medium. Such slowly slowing-down dynamics is likely to cause similar long cross-over phenomena in processes governed by wetting.},

  abstract = {Capillary-driven flow of a perfectly wetting liquid into circular cylindrical tubes is studied. Based on an analysis of previous approaches, a comprehensive theoretical model is presented which is not limited to certain special cases. This model considers the meniscus reorientation, the dynamic contact angle as well as inertia, convective, and viscous losses inside the tube and the reservoir. The capillary-driven flow is divided into three successive phases where first inertia then convective losses and finally viscous forces counteract the driving capillary force. This leads to an initial meniscus height increase proportional to the square of time followed by a linear dependence and finally the Lucas–Washburn behavior where the meniscus height is proportional to the square root of time. The three phases are separated by two characteristic transition times which are determined by the Ohnesorge number and the inertia of the liquid. Experiments were carried out under microgravity condition in a carefully chosen range of Ohnesorge numbers and initial liquid heights to cover the complete process from the initial meniscus development to the final Lucas–Washburn behavior. Good agreement of experimental and theoretical data is found throughout the complete range of experiment parameters. The existence of all three flow regimes predicted by the theory is verified by the experiments.},

The predictive capability offered by these methods is potentially large, joining theoretical and experimental methods. Several challenges rather unique to this area need to be overcome, however, notably regarding the conditions near a moving contact line and the very large separation of length scales in these flows. We first summarize the main models for moving contact lines and follow with an overview of computational methods that includes direct continuum approaches and macroscale models that resolve only the large-scale flow by modeling the effects of the conditions near the contact line using theory. Results are presented for contact-line motion on ideal as well as patterned and grooved surfaces and for extensions to account for complexities such as thermocapillarity and phase change.},

  abstract = {A Lattice-Boltzmann method based on field mediators is proposed to simulate the capillary rise between parallel plates by considering the effect of long-range interactions between the fluids and the solid walls. As a starting point, a liquid–vapor system was employed, which was modeled using a known model described in the literature. The simulations were compared with theoretical solutions of the Bosanquet equation. The results obtained are in good agreement with theoretical predictions, particularly when the dependence between the dynamic contact angle and the capillary number is taken into account. This dependence shows that on smooth and homogeneous solid surfaces, where pinning effects in the contact line are weak, the dynamic contact angle is linearly dependent on the capillary number, in good agreement with theoretical and experimental results available in the literature. Some discrepancies were observed in the first stages of the capillary rise when the distance between the parallel plates is large, considering the high complexity involved in predicting the initial meniscus formation. The results presented in this work appear to indicate that the inclusion of long-range forces does not change significantly the fluid flow dynamics at the mesoscopic level, at least, when ideally flat and homogeneous solid surfaces are used in the simulations.},

  abstract = {The classical Lucas−Washburn−Rideal (LWR) equation, using the equilibrium contact angle, predicts a faster capillary rise process than experiments in many cases. The major contributor to the faster prediction is believed to be the velocity dependent dynamic contact angle. In this work, we investigated the dynamic contact angle models for their ability to correct the dynamic contact angle effect in the capillary rise process. We conducted capillary rise experiments of various wetting liquids in borosilicate glass capillaries and compared the model predictions with our experimental data. The results show that the LWR equations modified by the molecular kinetic theory and hydrodynamic model provide good predictions on the capillary rise of all the testing liquids with fitting parameters, while the one modified by Joos’ empirical equation works for specific liquids, such as silicone oils. The LWR equation modified by molecular self-layering model predicts well the capillary rise of carbon tetrachloride, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, and n-alkanes with the molecular diameter or measured solvation force data. The molecular self-layering model modified LWR equation also has good predictions on the capillary rise of silicone oils covering a wide range of bulk viscosities with the same key parameter W(0), which results from the molecular self-layering. The advantage of the molecular self-layering model over the other models reveals the importance of the layered molecularly thin wetting film ahead of the main meniscus in the energy dissipation associated with dynamic contact angle. The analysis of the capillary rise of silicone oils with a wide range of bulk viscosities provides new insights into the capillary dynamics of polymer melts.},

  abstract = {It has already been asserted, by Mr. Monge and others, that the phenomena of capillary tubes are referable to the cohesive attraction of the superficial particles only of the fluids em­ployed, and that the surfaces must consequently be formed into curves of the nature of lintearias, which are supposed to be the results of a uniform tension of a surface, resisting the pressure of a fluid, either uniform, or varying according to a given law. Segner, who appears to have been the first that maintained a similar opinion, has shown in what manner the principle may be deduced from the doctrine of attraction, but his demonstration is complicated, and not perfectly satisfactory; and in applying the law to the forms of drops, he has neglected to consider the very material effects of the double curvature, which is evidently the cause of the want of a perfect coinci­dence of some of his experiments with his theory. Since the time of Segner, little has been done in investigating accurately and in detail the various consequences of the principle. It will perhaps be most agreeable to the experimental phi­losopher, although less consistent with the strict course of logical argument, to proceed in the first place to the comparison of this theory with the phenomena, and to inquire afterwards for its foundation in the ultimate properties of matter. But it is necessary to premise one observation, which appears to be new, and which is equally consistent with theory and with experiment; that is, that for each combination of a solid and a fluid, there is an appropriate angle of contact between the surfaces of the fluid, exposed to the air, and to the solid. This angle, for glass and water, and in all cases where a solid is perfectly wetted by a fluid, is evanescent: for glass and mer­cury, it is about 140°, in common temperatures, and when the mercury is moderately clean.},

The traditional sharpinterface Navier-Stokes formulation encounters a non-integrable stress singularity, which is commonly avoided by introducing slip at the contact line. In recent years, diffuse-interface models have emerged as an alternative method. They are attractive in regularizing the singularity in a more rational manner, and in the meantime supplying a means for describing the interfacial motion on the large scale. Although a number of groups have carried out diffuse-interface computations of moving contact lines, a closer inspection shows that some fundamental questions remain to be answered. For example, how can a sharp-interface limit be realized to produce a solution that is independent of the interfacial thickness? How to determine model parameters so as to match a specific experiment? Finally, is it possible to make quantitatively accurate predictions of the moving contact line using diffuse-interface models? Using the Cahn-Hilliard model as an example, we describe these issues and suggest solutions.},

  abstract = {The Cahn–Hilliard model uses diffusion between fluid components to regularize the stress singularity at a moving contact line. In addition, it represents the dynamics of the near-wall layer by the relaxation of a wall energy. The first part of the paper elucidates the role of the wall relaxation in a flowing system, with two main results. First, we show that wall energy relaxation produces a dynamic contact angle that deviates from the static one, and derive an analytical formula for the deviation. Second, we demonstrate that wall relaxation competes with Cahn–Hilliard diffusion in defining the apparent contact angle, the former tending to “rotate” the interface at the contact line while the latter to “bend” it in the bulk. Thus, varying the two in coordination may compensate each other to produce the same macroscopic solution that is insensitive to the microscopic dynamics of the contact line. The second part of the paper exploits this competition to develop a computational strategy for simulating realistic flows with microscopic slip length at a reduced cost. This consists in computing a moving contact line with a diffusion length larger than the real slip length, but using the wall relaxation to correct the solution to that corresponding to the small slip length. We derive an analytical criterion for the required amount of wall relaxation, and validate it by numerical results on dynamic wetting in capillary tubes and drop spreading.},

  abstract = {In the phase-field description of moving contact line problems, the two-phase system can be described by free energies, and the constitutive relations can be derived based on the assumption of energy dissipation. In this work we propose a novel boundary condition for contact angle hysteresis by exploring wall energy relaxation, which allows the system to be in non-equilibrium at the contact line. Our method captures pinning, advancing and receding automatically without the explicit knowledge of contact line velocity and contact angle. The microscopic dynamic contact angle is computed as part of the solution instead of being imposed. Furthermore, the formulation satisfies a dissipative energy law, where the dissipation terms all have their physical origin. Based on the energy law, we develop an implicit finite element method that is second order in time. The numerical scheme is proven to be unconditionally energy stable for matched density and zero contact angle hysteresis, and is numerically verified to be energy dissipative for a broader range of parameters. We benchmark our method by computing pinned drops and moving interfaces in the plane Poiseuille flow. When the contact line moves, its dynamics agrees with the Cox theory. In the test case of oscillating drops, the contact line transitions smoothly between pinning, advancing and receding. Our method can be directly applied to three-dimensional problems as demonstrated by the test case of sliding drops on an inclined wall.},

  abstract = {Dynamic wetting is a ubiquitous phenomenon and frequently observed in our daily life, as exemplified by the famous lotus effect. It is also an interfacial process of upmost importance involving many cutting-edge appli­ cations and has hence received significantly increasing academic and industrial attention for several decades. However, we are still far away to completely understand and predict wetting dynamics for a given system due to the complexity of this dynamic process. The physics of moving contact lines is mainly ascribed to the full coupling with the solid surface on which the liquids contact, the atmosphere surrounding the liquids, and the physico-chemical characteristics of the liquids involved (small-molecule liquids, metal liquids, polymer liquids, and simulated liquids). Therefore, to deepen the understanding and efficiently harness wetting dynamics, we propose to review the major advances in the available literature. After an introduction providing a concise and general background on dynamic wetting, the main theories are presented and critically compared. Next, the dynamic wetting of various liquids ranging from small-molecule liquids to simulated liquids are systematically summarized, in which the new physical concepts (such as surface segregation, contact line fluctuations, etc.) are particularly highlighted. Subsequently, the related emerging applications are briefly presented in this review. Finally, some tentative suggestions and challenges are proposed with the aim to guide future developments.},
